# Learning about Version Control

by: Vy Phan

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like how version control lets me track changes over time and see exactly what was added or removed.

I find merging changes from different branches confusing at times, especially when conflicts appear and I’m not sure which version to keep.
